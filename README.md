# euvat

How to run:<br />
CLI command "mvn clean instal" will generate executable jar in target folder however i added builded jar into git anyway.

Notes:<br />
I am aware about lack of javadoc and comments which I am usualy write to allmost all (non-getter/setter) methods, but I gues this is more about my coding skills (I can add). Suggestion to keep it simple was not exactly followed but i wanted to make it extensible and generic as possible.
There is several ways to generate executable jar by maven, I decided for spring boot maven plugin, cause Spring Boot was mentioned in job requirements so why not :)

Log:<br />
App should generate log file EUVAT-log.log (only errors now).

Main:<br />
Main method is placed in Demo.java
